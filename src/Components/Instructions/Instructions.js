      <h1>How to play the game War!</h1>
      <p>
        <b>Objective: </b>The objective of the game is to collect all cards.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Number of Players: </b>2 players
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Number of Cards: </b>Standard 52 card deck
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Card Ranking: </b>Ace (high), King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5,
        4, 3, and 2 (low).
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>The Deal: </b>Each player receives 26 cards, placed face down on
        their section of the board.
      </p>

      <h2>Game Play</h2>
      <p>
        Players flip a single card from their hand, placing it face up in the
        center of the table.
      </p>
      <p>
        The player with the higher card wins and collects both cards, returning
        the cards to their personal deck.
      </p>
      <p>If players flip the same card, a battle begins.</p>

      <h2>Battle</h2>
      <p>
        During a battle, each player places four more cards on the table.
        Whoeverâ€™s fourth card is the highest is the winner, and they collect all
        the cards (10 in total), and the next round begins. If the fourth cards
        are also the same, repeat the previous instructions until there is a
        winner.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a player does not have enough cards for the battle, that player
        forfeits their remaining cards to their opponent and the game is over.
      </p>

      <h2>Winning the Game</h2>
      <p>
        The player that collects all 52 cards into their deck wins the game.
